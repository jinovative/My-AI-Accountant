# Service Temporarily Suspended

The service is currently unavailable due to the following issue:

```json
error: {
    message: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.",
    type: "insufficient_quota",
    param: null,
    code: "insufficient_quota"
}

### Issue Explanation
This service relies on the OpenAI API, and we have exceeded the allocated API usage quota. As a result, we are unable to process any further requests at this time.

### Resolution Plan
To resume the service, we are taking the following steps:
- **API Usage Review and Plan Upgrade**: We are reviewing our API usage and will upgrade the plan to accommodate increased demand.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: We are optimizing the service to reduce unnecessary API calls and enhance stability.

### Expected Timeline
We are actively working to resolve the issue and aim to resume the service as soon as possible. Updates will be shared through this document or other official channels.

We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you.
